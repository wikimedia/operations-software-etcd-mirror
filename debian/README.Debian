etcd-mirror for Debian
---------------------

You will be able to use the etcd-mirror binary as a service via its systemd unit.
By default the service will not start. To enable it, you have to configure it by
either editing the defaults file, or by writing a systemd override file. Once you've
done that you can simply unmask it:

 # systemctl unmask etcd-mirror.service
